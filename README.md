# NumberGuessingGame

⦁	Write a game application that generates a random number between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and prompts the user for a guess. Use as the pseudorandom number generator the Random class. When the user guesses the correct number, say so, and display how many guesses the user required to guess correctly. Allow the user to play multiple times by asking the user if the user wants to continue playing.

     Guess my number between 1 and 1000 => 500
     Too high
     Guess again => 250
     Too high
     Guess again => 125
     Too low
     . . .
     Guess again => 132
     You guessed the number!
     You required 14 tries.
     Do you want to play again (y or n) => n
